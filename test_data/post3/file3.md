## The Sun's Song (in Markdown)

*A haiku*

Golden orb ascends,
Bathing the world in its light,
Life thrives in its warmth.

**Sun Shower**

> The sun peeked through a veil of clouds,
> A fleeting smile on a tearful face.
> Diamonds danced on thirsty leaves,
> A sparkling, unexpected grace.

**Sunsets in Monochrome (italics)**

The _blazing sun_ descends, a fiery _orb_ fading.
_Silhouettes_ stretch long, shadows reaching for the _twilight_.
The world hushes, cloaked in _shades of gray_,
_Awaiting_ the moon's gentle _illumination_.
